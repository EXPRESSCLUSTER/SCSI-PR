# Set up SCSI-PR with EXPRESSCLUSTER X on Windows

Install EXPRESSCLUSTER X 4.2 with instructions for using a shared disk. A disk heartbeat partition is not needed on the shared disk for this configuration.

We don't use any NP resources because SCSI-PR function works like NP resources.

Download the scripts for EXPRESSCLUSTER shared disk with SCSI persistent reservation.
